    <p>
        When learning a language it's not always easy to remember all the vocabulary.
        Langcab will help you remember your words by using a spaced repetition algorithm.
        <br />
        Even the process of adding words into the system will steady your vocabulary.
        You can add as many languages as you want.<br />
        To use it just <a [routerLink]="homeUrl()" (click)="showLogin()">sign in</a> and start by <a [routerLink]="addUrl()">adding your first word</a>!

                        <p class="card-text">Many studies have found out that writing a word helps us remember it. Especially for languages with a different alphabet. It is highly efficient to physically write down words when adding as well as studying them. Together with the spaced repetition algorithm studying will be much easier. To avoid wasting paper it may be worth buying a small cleanable board.</p>
