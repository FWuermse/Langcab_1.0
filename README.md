# LangCab

A web app that is supposed to help me with my Chinese.
If I had spent the time I coded this studying I would be fluent by now.

Worth it!

Oh and 
[AngularDart](https://webdev.dartlang.org/components) is cool!

## Run locally

To run this app locally you'll need to install dart.
Once dart and the package manager pub is successfully installed run:

```sh
dart pub global activate webdev
dart pub get
webdev serve --debug
```
